        a single magic number - unsurprisingly it's pretty intense behind the scenes. We have

                Thermal age expresses the age of a sample in "equivalent years at 10Â°C" for a given reaction.
                It is an absolute measure, meaning that two different bones with the same (DNA depurination)
                thermal age should have experienced the same amount of bond breakage due to depurination and will
                have the same mean fragment length and fragment length distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This property makes thermal age useful for comparing samples of different ages and from different
                sites, e.g. for choosing which one of two samples to spend limited funds on sampling.

                Because thermal age is the absolute amount of a reaction which has taken place in a sample, we
                can define thermal ages above which DNA is so degraded as to be not worth sampling. This varies
                with experimental design and sequencing methodology.

                You can work out thermal age two ways, by estimating the temperature history, or by
                extracting the DNA and having a look at it. Knowing where in the world a bone has
                come from and a little about its burial conditions allows us to work backwards in time,
                modelling the thermal age until it matches the measured value. The point at which it
                matches is an estimate of the age of the sample.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a new dating technique and since it is hard to quantify the error associated
                with it, it may be more helpful for testing between distinct age
                hypotheses rather than attaining a water-tight date.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe this technique has exciting potential as a dating proxy using other
                molecules than DNA, so we'll perhaps be making announcements about this in the future.
                It's here for your entertainment until then!
