        Our technology will boil tens of thousands of years of underground temperature fluctuation down to
        a single magic number - unsurprisingly it's pretty intense behind the scenes. We have

                Thermal age expresses the age of a sample in "equivalent years at 10Â°C" for a given reaction.
                It is an absolute measure, meaning that two different bones with the same (DNA depurination)
                thermal age should have experienced the same amount of bond breakage to depurination and will
                have the same mean fragment length and fragment length distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                This property makes thermal age useful for comparing samples of different ages and from different
                sites, e.g. for choosing which one of two samples to spend limited funds on sampling.

                Because thermal age is an absolute amount of a reaction which has taken place in a sample, we
                can define cut-offs above which DNA is so degraded as to be not worth sampling. This varies
                with experimental design and sequencing methodology.
