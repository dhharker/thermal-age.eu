Description
-----------

Starting with PDF 1.3 (Adobe Acrobat 4.0), PDF files can contain file
attachments -- arbitrary files that a reader can extract, just like
attachments to an e-mail message.  The attachfile package brings this
functionality to pdfLaTeX and provides some additional features not
available in Acrobat, such as the ability to use arbitrary LaTeX code
for the file icon -- including things like \includegraphics, tabular,
and math.  Settings can be made either globally or on a per-attachment
basis.  attachfile makes it easy to attach files and customize their
appearance in the enclosing document.

Building attachfile
and its documentation
---------------------

tex attachfile.ins       <== Produces attachfile.sty (the package proper)
pdflatex attachfile.dtx  <== Produces attachfile.pdf (documentation)
makeindex -s gind.ist attachfile  <== Produces attachfile.ind (index)
makeindex -s gglo.ist attachfile.glo -o attachfile.gls  <== (change log)
pdflatex attachfile.dtx  <== Merges index + change log into the documentation
pdflatex attachfile.dtx  <== Produces final version of attachfile.pdf

Note that attachfile comes with pre-built documentation (PDF format,
U.S. letter-sized paper), so you really need to perform only the first
step above unless you're unhappy with the documentation as provided.
